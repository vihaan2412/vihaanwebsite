    <p class="para">Rare earths, also known as rare earth elements (REEs), are a group of 17 chemical elements that are essential to modern technology. They include the 15 lanthanides, plus scandium and yttrium, which have similar chemical properties. These elements are critical components in many high-tech products such as smartphones, electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defense systems.</p>

    <p class="para">Despite their name, rare earths are not actually rare. They are found in small quantities in the Earth's crust, but they are widely distributed and can be found in many parts of the world. However, the process of extracting and refining rare earths can be complex and expensive, making them relatively expensive compared to other metals.

    <p class="para">Each rare earth element has unique properties that make it useful in specific applications. For example, neodymium is used in the production of powerful magnets that are used in motors for electric vehicles and wind turbines, while europium is used to create the red phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. The importance of rare earths in modern technology has made them strategically important, with China currently producing over 80% of the world's rare earths. This has led to concerns about supply chain security and the need for diversification of rare earth sources. In summary, rare earths are a group of 17 chemical elements that are essential to modern technology. They are not actually rare, but their extraction and refinement can be complex and expensive. Each rare earth element has unique properties that make it useful in specific applications, and their importance in high-tech products has made them strategically important.</p>
